= 1.4 (2013-05-14)

 * Added proper and now fully-working support for HTML/TEXT e-mail.
 * Prettified the sample templates.
 * Exceptions give more info, if TemplateTypeEnum.ANY yields a FileNotFoundException.
 * Improved the documentation of the Test case.
 * ATTENTION: if you're using this in a framework that has a pre-bundled version of commons-email.jar somewhere in its folder (such as the Play! Framework 1.2.x) then you will have to replace it with this library's version of commons-email (v1.3.1), simply by overwriting it.
